# Hi, I'm Bernardo 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I work in **Data & Analytics**, with a strong focus on turning
**messy, real-world data into information people can actually trust**.

My background combines analytical skills with a solid understanding of
**business processes**, which means I care not only about *what* the data says,
but whether it is reliable enough to support decisions, analytics or AI.

I believe data is more than numbers —  
it’s a system of definitions, assumptions and trade-offs that must be made explicit.

---

## 🔎 What I focus on

- Data quality as a **foundational layer**, not a cleanup task  
- Working with imperfect, inconsistent and evolving data sources  
- Bridging business logic with technical implementation  
- Making data limitations visible instead of hiding them downstream  

I’m less interested in hype and more in:
**clarity, consistency and trust in data**.

## 📌 Featured Repositories

- **[Data Quality Hell](https://github.com/bnovelorotger/data_quality_hell_project)**  
  A real-world data quality project focused on common production problems:
  inconsistent schemas, ambiguous roles, missing values and unclear definitions.
  
  The goal is not to create a “perfect” dataset,
  but to build **reliable foundations before analytics or AI**.

- **[Data Science Salary Analysis](https://github.com/bnovelorotger/analisis_salarios_data_science_20-24)**  
  An analysis of data science salary trends across sources and regions,
  focused on extracting insights that are useful for both professionals
  and companies.
