# Hi, I'm Bernardo 👋

I work in **Data & Analytics**, with a strong focus on turning
**messy, real-world data into information people can actually trust**.

My background combines analytical skills with a solid understanding of
**business processes**, which means I care not only about *what* the data says,
but whether it is reliable enough to support decisions, analytics or AI.

I believe data is more than numbers —  
it’s a system of definitions, assumptions and trade-offs that must be made explicit.

## 🔎 What I focus on

- Data quality as a **foundational layer**, not a cleanup task  
- Working with imperfect, inconsistent and evolving data sources  
- Bridging business logic with technical implementation  
- Making data limitations visible instead of hiding them downstream  

I’m less interested in hype and more in:
**clarity, consistency and trust in data**.
